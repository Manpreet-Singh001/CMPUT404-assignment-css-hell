                <p>I As a third-year computer science student,
                I am passionate about technology and have a strong interest in backend engineering.
                Currently, I work as a TA for a computer science course, where I lead weekly discussions, grade assignments, and provide one-on-one support to students.
                My experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, and Javascript has allowed me to tackle complex coding problems with ease, and my dedication to learning has helped me to develop expertise in database management and API development.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and exploring new technologies.
                I am excited to continue deepening my understanding of backend engineering and gaining more practical experience in the field as I progress in my studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can make full stack applications.
